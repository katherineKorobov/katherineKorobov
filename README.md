# About Me:
I'm Katherine, an undergraduate Aerospace Engineering student at the University of Colorado Boulder. I am pursuing a double minor in Computer Science and Physics to complement my engineering studies and broaden my technical expertise.

I am particularly fascinated by aircraft control, astro/aerodynamics, and spacecraft engineering. Through my studies, I have developed a solid foundation in software. I am currently working on projects for CU Sounding Rocketry Labratory and CSML/VADeR lab at Colorado Center for Astrodynamics Research .

Beyond acadmeics, I find inspiration in reading science fiction and philosophy, which fuels my curiousity and critical thinking. I also enjoy spending time outdoors hiking and running.
