# About Me:
I'm Katherine, an undergraduate Aerospace Engineering student at the University of Colorado Boulder with a passion for problem solving. I am pursuing a double minor in Computer Science and Physics to complement my engineering studies and broaden my technical expertise.

I am particularly fascinated by aircraft control, aerodynamic design, and spacecraft engineering. Through my studies, I have developed a solid foundation in software implementation. I am currently working on many projects for CU Sounding Rocketry Labratory; Dynamics and Controls Lab; and Aerospace Vehicle Design Lab.

Beyond acadmeics, I find inspiration in reading science fiction and philosophy, which fuels my curiousity and critical thinking. I also enjoy spending time outdoors, hiking and playing soccer.
