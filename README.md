# ðŸ’« About Me:
I'm Katherine, an undergraduate Aerospace Engineering student at the University of Colorado Boulder with a passion for problem solving and exploring the complexities of our world. I am also pursuing a double minor in Computer Science and Physics to complement my engineering studies and broaden my technical expertise.

I am particularly fascinated by aircraft control, aerodynamic design, and spacecraft engineering. Through my studies, I have developed a solid foundation in software implementation. One of my recent projects involved designing and implementing a Graphical User Interface for a team-built Automated Greenhouse, that provided real-time updates and data to a desktop browser, enhancing the systems usability and functionality.

Beyond acadmeics, I find inspiration in reading science fiction and philosophy, which fuels my curiousity and critical thinking. I also enjoy spending time outdoors, hiking and playing soccer.
